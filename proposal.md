# X-Team 57 Project Proposal

See https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code for tips on using *Markdown* tags to format __.md__ files

## Goal

Work as a team to create a project proposal for your X-team to complete together.
The project does not have to be extremely difficult,
but there must be work to do for each member of your team.
You may reference figures using "See figure 1".  
Be sure to submit corresponding image files, i.e. figure1.png (or figure1.jpg) for each figure.

## Grading: To earn full credit, your team's proposal must include:

* (md) documentation: [this file] describing purpose and use of your program

* Description of a program that has:

  ** a main Java program class in a file named Main.java
  
  ** a custom data structure designed and built by your team
  
  ** comprehensive testing of individual units
  
 Caution: You are not being asked to implement this program, at least not yet. 
 We just want your group to make a proposal or pitch for your program.
 
 Tip: Your custom data structure can be composed of or extensions of data structures that you have learned and used in previous programming assignments.  We're looking for decisions about how to build a high-level data structure that will likely have lower-level components.

## Problem Description
Our problem that we are going to solve, is our professor only has a regulor 

## Questions to answer for Exercise #2

1. Name: Give your project proposal a name (and edit the top line of this file)



2. Output: Describe the output your program will produce.  Include and example format of the output produced.

3. Input: Describe the data that is needed to solve your problem. Include an example format of the input data.



4. User Interface: Describe a user interface for your program.  Use text menus or a simple graphic user interface.
The interface should have insert, search, printInLastNameOrder, and printInGradeOrder method


5. Types List: Break your solution idea down into units that you think can be implemented with a single class.
In the gradebook class, we could create a new gradebook instance and add all student's name and insert their grade to the gradebook, and we would be able to sort the gradebook in two orders: one that sorts the gradebook in the order of Last name, the other sorts in the order of scores from highest to lowest


Name each interface or class and briefly describe its function or purpose.
Gradebook interface: create a new gradebook
Student interface: create a new student instance
Student class: create a new student with Frist and last name, and his/her status
sortedGradebook class: create a new gradebook, insert students with name, scores, and status. Then sort it into different order we want
