See https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code for tips on using *Markdown* tags to format __.md__ files

## Goal

Work as a team to create a project proposal for your X-team to complete together.
The project does not have to be extremely difficult,
but there must be work to do for each member of your team.
You may reference figures using "See figure 1".  
Be sure to submit corresponding image files, i.e. figure1.png (or figure1.jpg) for each figure.

## Grading: To earn full credit, your team's proposal must include:

* (md) documentation: [this file] describing purpose and use of your program

* Description of a program that has:

  ** a main Java program class in a file named Main.java
  
  ** a custom data structure designed and built by your team
  
  ** comprehensive testing of individual units
  
 Caution: You are not being asked to implement this program, at least not yet. 
 We just want your group to make a proposal or pitch for your program.
 
 Tip: Your custom data structure can be composed of or extensions of data structures that you have learned and used in previous programming assignments.  We're looking for decisions about how to build a high-level data structure that will likely have lower-level components.

## Problem Description

Our problem that we are going to solve, is our professor only has a regular gradebook system where she has everything in a paper gradebook. They are having problems reporting and looking at the grades for each specific student.

Our solutiom to this problem is to create a grading book system by getting input from the user to input their name, ID number, grade and status in school. We have features on the program to Create gradebook file, Sort the file and Save the file. we will have 3 input grades from midterm1,midterm2,and final grade. we will have different weights of the different exams, and their final grade will be output.
## Questions to answer for Exercise #2

3. Input: Names (first name, last names), student ID, midterm and final grades. 



4. User Interface: Describe a user interface for your program.  Use text menus or a simple graphic user interface.



5. Types List: Break your solution idea down into units that you think can be implemented with a single class.



Name each interface or class and briefly describe its function or purpose.
