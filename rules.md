# X-Team 57 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will communicate through our group chat to distribute tasks and establish meeting times and deadlines.
For each task each member should feel a little challenged, but a not completely lost.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Communication through group chat or verbal confirmation with completion or questions.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Ask other group members for help first, then reach out to TA or Deb. All conflict will be resolved with a duel of rock paper scissors


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Check in with other group members to assure that nobody is left behind. If someone doesnt know how to do a task, we can collaberate on how to finish it.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Team leader buys pizza from funds of team members
have fun
